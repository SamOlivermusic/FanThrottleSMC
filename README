FanThrottleSMC

Throttles the maximum fan speeds in your Macbook. 
Wrote this little piece due to a defective thermal sensor in my macbook. Its only purpose is to prevent my fans from torturing my nerves.

BE CAREFUL!
Setting the maximum speed of your fans to a value too low while doing hard work on your CPUs could result in a overheated, throttling and unusable machine. Maybe it'll even break. 


In order to run this application you need to install smcFanControl (http://www.eidac.de/?p=134) in your /Applications/-Folder.
